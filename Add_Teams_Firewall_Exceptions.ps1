## This is a workaround for Microsoft's interesting coding choices for Teams.
## As a quick summary, Teams requires firewall rules that are specific to each user on the machine.
## If they aren't there, Teams pops up a prompt asking to add them.
## It's an elevated prompt which reults in helpdesk ticket if they aren't admins (and they should not be!)
## Uservoice for more info: https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/33697582-microsoft-teams-windows-firewall-pop-up

## As a basic rundown, this script:
## Gets the user that triggered the script by looking at the Task Scheduler log
## Trims the domain from the result to give just the username
## To get the root path (99% of the time it's C:\Users\), it looks up where #env:public points to and uses that
## Then it takes a few variables and builds the path to the Teams.exe file.
## With the user file path built (whew.), it checks to see Teams has already created the TCP\UDP block rules. If it finds them, it deletes them (I like consistency). 
## With a clean slate, it then checks to see if the rules have been added before, and if not, creates them.

## To set up, modify the variables in the first section below.
## With the changes made, copy the script somewhere local on the machine, then create a Scheduled Task that triggers on user logon and executes this script.
## I do the above with a GPO, but other methods will work as long as the end result is the same.

## Computer > Preferences > Windows Settings > Files > File/Target Path: C:\Users\Public\Add_Teams_Firewall_Exceptions.p1, copied from a local share everyone can access
## Computer > Preferences > Control Panel Settings > Scheduled Tasks > Win7 Task called Teams_Firewall_Rules_All_Users
## -Action: Update
## -RunAs: SYSTEM / run whether the user is logged on or not / Run with highest privileges 
## -Triggered at log on of any users
## -Actions, Start a Program > powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -file "C:\Users\Public\Add_Teams_Firewall_Exceptions.ps1"

#-----------------------------#
#   Set your variables here!  #
#-----------------------------#

## First, set the program location that exists under the user's profile. The rest of the script builds the beginning of the path.
$pathtoexe = '\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams\current\teams.exe'
## Set the name you want the rule to be called in Windows Defender Advanced Firewall.
$firewallRuleName = 'teams.exe'
## The script searches the scheduled task logs. Set the Scheduled Task name you intend to use here.
$scheduledtaskname = 'Teams_Firewall_Rules_All_Users'
## Set the domain you want this to work in. To see what this value should be, run 'whoami' from a logged in user and look for the name before the \.
$domainname = "CONTOSO"
## Set where you want your log file to save
$logfilepath = 'C:\Install_Log\TeamsFWRules.log'
